                Our story began in 1975, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
                From the beginning, our goal was to create software that made technology accessible and useful to everyone. Microsoft's first big success was MS-DOS, an operating system that revolutionized the way personal computers worked. And in 1985, we launched Windows, which brought a graphical user interface, making computers more friendly and accessible. In the 1990s, Microsoft played an important role in the growth of the Internet. Its browser, Internet Explorer,
                 became one of the most used browsers at the time, making it easier for people to access the web.

                Innovation has always been our motto. We developed products that shaped the technology world, 
                such as the Office package, with programs like Word,
                 Excel and PowerPoint, which improved personal and business productivity.
                 In addition, Windows Server has become the backbone of companies worldwide.
                <br>
                And now, we are proud to introduce Microsoft 365. 
                This revolutionary productivity suite includes all the essential resources for its success.
                 With applications like Word, Excel, 
                 PowerPoint and Outlook, you can create, collaborate and communicate effectively. 
                 Work from anywhere safely and efficiently, thanks to our ability to work remote. 
                And, of course, our priority is to keep your data secure with advanced security and compliance features.
                <br>
                We are continually investing in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence,
                 mixed reality and quantum computing to shape a better future.
                  So join us in this exciting journey towards the future! Welcome to Microsoft, 
                where technology and Microsoft 365 are ready to help you perform your unlimited potential.
